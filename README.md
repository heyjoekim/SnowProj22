# SnowProj22 - Final Project for CEE609 EnvDatSci
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Dependencies
1. Anaconda
2. You need to have a NASA Earthdata Login
### 1.2 Running the Code
To run the code should be easy to do. First, clone the github repo in a terminal or Anaconda Power Shell.
```
git clone https://github.com/heyjoekim/SnowProj22
```
Alternatively, you can download the zipped file. After that, change into the repo saved onto your device. We need to make the script that will run all of the code executable first
```
cd SnowProj22
chmod +x run_snowproj.sh
```
After that the code should run without any errors
```
sh run_snowproj.sh <uid> <password>
```
The `<uid>` and `<password>` are the username and password for NASA Earthdata Login. Delete these and add your username and password to be able to download the files.
