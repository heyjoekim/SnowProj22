## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Dependencies
### 1.2 Running the Code
To run the code should be easy to do. First, clone the github repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/heyjoekim/SnowProj22
```
Alternatively, you can download the zipped file. We need to make the script that will run all of the code executable first
```
chmod +x run_data_process.sh
```
After that the code should run without any errors
```
sh run_data_process.sh
```
